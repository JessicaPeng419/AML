Survival analysis - Predictors of stell cell treatment failure in AML

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a blood malignancy characterized by aberrant bone marrow progenitor cell proliferation and halted differentiation. 

## Data Source and Sample collection
This is a retrospective observational cohort study with data from AML patients who received whole blood transplants at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) between January 2014 and June 2020. Patients completed a conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine-melphalan and received allogeneic HSCT. This included the use of matched related donor (MRD), 12/12 matched unrelated donor (MUD) or allogeneic cord graft (haplo-ord). GVHD prophylaxis includes tacrolimus and mycophenolate and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).
